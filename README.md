# Google Location with Distance Project

This project is an implementation of Google location with distance functionality. It allows users to input their pickup and drop locations and calculates the distance between them using Google Maps API. The project is divided into a frontend and backend, both of which need to be set up and started separately.

## Features

- Input pickup and drop locations
- Calculate distance between the locations
- Utilize Google Maps API for geocoding and distance calculation

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Backend: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
- MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/

## Getting Started

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory: `cd frontend`.
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the frontend development server: `npm start`.
4. The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory: `cd backend`.
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Start the backend server: `npm start`.
4. The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

1. Access the frontend application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
2. Enter the pickup and drop locations in the respective input fields.
3. The distance between the locations will be calculated automatically.
4. You can submit the form to perform any additional actions or integrations with the calculated distance.
